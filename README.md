# 210-arduino

Arduino code created for a water quality testing device.

The arduino read input from a pH sensor and a turbidity sensor and determined if the water was safe to drink by comparing it to the "safe" threshold. The results were then printed on an LCD screen and an LED lit up if the water was safe to drink.
